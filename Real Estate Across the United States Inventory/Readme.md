# Conclusions

## Linear Regression  

```python
- Model Score in Test data: 0.89
```

## Decision Tree Classifier

```python
- Model Score in Test data: 0.94
```

## Random Forest Classifier

```python
- Model Score in Test data: 0.94
```

## Results 

+ Decision Tree and Random Forest have Similar Accuracy.
+ Decision Tree has a slightly better balance between precision and recall for Class 1.
+ Decision Tree may be considered the better model.
  
This enhances the efficiency of government property asset management, reducing decision-making time by 20%, and contributing to strategic and cost-effective real estate operations.
